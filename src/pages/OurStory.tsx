    year: "2008",
    title: "The Beginning",
    body: "AURA was founded in a small atelier in Mumbai by two designers who shared a single conviction: that premium fashion should never compromise on ethics. With a team of six artisans and one sewing machine, we created our first capsule collection of twelve pieces.",
  },
  {
    year: "2011",
    title: "Our First Brand — Terracotta Threads",
    body: "Inspired by the earthy pigments of India's artisan heartlands, Terracotta Threads became our first fully launched brand. The debut collection sold out in three days. We knew we had struck something deep.",
  },
  {
    year: "2014",
    title: "Aurora Launches",
    body: "Aurora was born from a desire to push boundaries. Where Terracotta Threads honours the past, Aurora reimagines the future — iridescent silks, architectural cuts, and textiles that catch and scatter light like a dawn sky.",
  },
  {
    year: "2017",
    title: "Golden Gauge Joins the Family",
    body: "Our most precision-driven brand, Golden Gauge, launched to celebrate the art of tailoring at its purest. Each piece is hand-finished and comes with a lifetime alteration guarantee — a statement of confidence in our craft.",
  },
  {
    year: "2020",
    title: "Going Carbon-Neutral by 2030",
    body: "Amid a global reckoning with climate, AURA made its most consequential commitment: full carbon neutrality across all brands and supply chains by 2030. We formed Golden Labs to lead our R&D into bio-based fabrics and closed-loop production.",
  },
  {
    year: "Today",
    title: "Growing With Purpose",
    body: "AURA now operates across three continents, employs over 2,000 people, and serves customers in 40 countries. But our soul remains unchanged — a small atelier in Mumbai, two designers, and an absolute refusal to compromise.",
